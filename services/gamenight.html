				Every week in the RiiConnect24 Discord server, we pick a Wii and DS/3DS game to play on <a href="https://wiimmfi.de/">Wiimmfi</a> with other Discord users. DS/3DS games are played on Friday, and Wii games are played on Saturday. We have smashed the record of the maximum users online at once for a game multiple times!
				<br>
				Instead of playing games like Mario Kart Wii (the most popular game on Wiimmfi by far), we like to play more obscure gems that are fun to play but don't get a lot of attention.
				<br>
				To participate in Game Nights, join the Discord server, go to #random, and type in `/roleme Wii Game Night` and/or `/roleme DS/3DS Game Night`.
