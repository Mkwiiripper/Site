			Every week in the RiiConnect24 Discord server, we pick a Wii and DS/3DS game to play on <a
				href="https://wiimmfi.de/">Wiimmfi</a> with other Discord users. 3DS games are played on Friday, and
			Wii games are played on Saturday.
			<br>
			We like to play more obscure gems that are fun to play but don't get a lot of attention.
			<br>
			To participate in Game Nights, join the Discord server, go to #random, and type in `/roleme Wii Game Night`
			and/or `/roleme DS/3DS Game Night`.
